![Coding Banner](coding_banner.png)

Welcome to my little empire of **coding grind + brain gains** 🌸  
This repo is where I solve challenges, practice languages, and flex my problem-solving muscle.  
From *beginner-friendly scripts* to *platform-based challenges*, it’s all here — organized, neat, and growing with me 🚀
