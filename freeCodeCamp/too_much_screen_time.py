# Given an input array of seven integers, representing a week's time, where each integer is the amount of hours spent on your phone that day, determine if it is too much screen time based on these constraints:

#If any single day has 10 hours or more, it's too much.
#If the average of any three days in a row is greater than or equal to 8 hours, itâ€™s too much.
#If the average of the seven days is greater than or equal to 6 hours, it's too much.
